1.) simulated_web.py- This is the main source code in which it generates the adjacency graph of simulated web by randomly removing the species from the control web and     implementing the rewiring alogorithm and finally comparing it with the adjacency graph of the drought web.

2.) food_web.py- This code is used to generate the food web structure of control web and drought web.

3.) overlap_graph.py- This code is used to generate the predator-overlap graph.

4.) rewiring_graph.py- This code is used to generate the rewiring graph of the food web network.
