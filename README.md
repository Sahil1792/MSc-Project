The importance of this project is to mainly understand the concept and examine the effects of "Rewiring" approach on empirical data of food webs by investigating how the species switch their diet following the primary species removal from the food web structure. After the removal of species, how the connections of removed species prey rewire with a potential predator to get the understanding of trophic interactions between the predators and prey. The primary species removal also sometimes leads to the rise of the isolated species known as secondary extinctions which are left with no predators and preys in the food web structure. Then, the removal of those isolated species is also important. This project also covers the study on secondary extinctions to get a clear understanding of the complex food web structure. 

The 'py' files attached describes:

1.) simulated_web.py- This is the main source code in which it generates the adjacency graph of simulated web by randomly removing the species from the control web and     implementing the rewiring alogorithm and finally comparing it with the adjacency graph of the drought web.

2.) food_web.py- This code is used to generate the food web structure of control web and drought web.

3.) overlap_graph.py- This code is used to generate the predator-overlap graph.

4.) rewiring_graph.py- This code is used to generate the rewiring graph of the food web network.
